## Description
Home assignment 2 (b)  
Implementation of reverse Polish notation.   Accepts a string with operands and operations (separated by spaces) as input and returns the calculated number  
I put the add and remove operations from the stack in different functions.  
 I also specified double in the stack data type, since the division operation may result in a non-integer number.  
I decided to remove the spaces so that it does not interfere with the function of the main algorithm
